# Title: To-do Together

## What and Why?

In our increasingly distracting world, it is becoming harder and harder to get things done. To-do lists have always been a good way to try and reclaim one's own productivity, but a checkbox doesn't always convey just how important completing a given task is in reality. Thus, we often ignore our todo lists until the last minute. So how does one ensure that they will stay on task? Enter **To-do together**. To-do together matches you with an accountability partner, someone who you will check in with daily, to make sure the two of you have completed your tasks for the previous day, and will stay on task today. From my own experience working with accountability partners, I've found that knowing someone is going to check in with me at the end of the day to be highly motivating. I believe accountability partners are a fantastic tool for productivity, and everyone should have one!

## For whom?

This application is for anyone who wants to increase their productivity in some way, whether it be that they want to pick up a new hobby, perform better at work/school, or branch out socially. Ideally, a satisfied user would be one who began to achieve their goals as a reuslt of using our application.

## How?

Users will have to log in or sign up from the landing page. After that, they are presented with two options for obtaining an accountability partner: "Invite a friend", or "Search for a partner". If they choose Invite a friend, they enter an email to whom a request will be sent. If they choose search for a partner, and an available partner is found immediately, they will be matched. Alternatively, they will be put on a list of those searching for partners. After this, they will proceed onto the main site.

The main site allows users to create a todo list for their day, and check off tasks as they are completed. Each day a user can enter up to 3 main goals (those most important) and an unlimited amount of minor goals. Once you are matched with a partner, you can also view their goals. On logging in for the first time in a day, you will be presented with your partner's checklist for the day prior, along with a prompt to message your partner, perhaps commending them for what they accomplished, or giving them constructive criticism on how they can do better. 

If things aren't working out with a user's partner (for instance, they aren't compatible with their partner, or their partner rarely logs in), they can remove their current partner and request a new one. Again, they will be presented with the original two options for finding a partner. This removal will block the other user, so that the two will not be matched again.

If you click an invitation link, after logging in/signing up you will be prompted to accept or decline the partner request. If you accept but already are on the partner waiting list, you will be removed, and if you have already sent out an invite, it will be deactivated. 

## Scope

I believe this project to be of reasonable scope for a semester long project. It encompasses all of what we'll be learning through the course (UX, front-end, back-end, a simple database for storing users and their goals), but it doesn't require an exceptional amount of depth or detail for any of these aspects. If it did prove to be too simple, we could always develop additional features, such as having multiple partners/groups, or deciding how often you'd like to check in with your partner.
