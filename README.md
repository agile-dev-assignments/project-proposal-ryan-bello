# Project Name: To-do Together

## What and Why?

In our increasingly distracting world, it is becoming harder and harder to get things done. To-do lists have always been a good way to try and reclaim one's own productivity, but a checkbox doesn't always convey just how important completing a given task is in reality. Thus, we often ignore our todo lists until the last minute. So how does one ensure that they will stay on task? Enter **To-do together**. To-do together matches you with an accountability partner, someone who will check in with you daily, to make sure the two of you have completed your tasks for the previous day, and will stay on task today. From my own experience working with accountability partners, I've found that knowing someone is going to check in with me at the end of the day to be highly motivating. I believe accountability partners are a fantastic tool for productivity, and everyone should have one!

## For whom?

This application is for anyone who wants to increase their productivity in some way, whether it be that they want to pick up a new hobby, perform better at work/school, or branch out socially. Ideally, a satisfied user would be one who began to achieve their goals as a reuslt of using our application.

## How?

### Landing Page / Signing Up

Users will have to log in or sign up from the landing page. After that, they are presented with two options for obtaining an accountability partner: "Invite a friend", or "Search for a partner". If they choose "Invite a friend", they enter an email to whom a invitation link will be sent. If they choose "Search for a partner", they will have to pick their main focus for improvement, and then will be put on a matchmaking list. After this, they will proceed onto the main site.

### Main Site

The main site allows users to create a todo list for their day, and check off tasks as they are completed. Each day a user can enter up to 3 main goals (those most important) and an unlimited amount of minor goals. Once you are matched with a partner, you can also view their goals. On logging in for the first time in a day, you will be presented with your partner's checklist for the day prior, along with a prompt to message your partner, perhaps commending them for what they accomplished, or giving them constructive criticism on how they can do better. Users will also always be able to access a chatbox with their partner.

### Partner Matchmaking (May be cut due to scope)

If you choose to search for a partner, you will be prompted to pick from a set of categories what your main focus for improvement is. For example: health, exercise, diet, schoolwork, art, etc. The app will try its best to match you with someone with similar goals by the next day, but if noone similar is found, you may be matched with someone who does not have similar interests. Regardless, you and your partner will both be asked to approve the match, and if you both do, you will become partners.

This feature may be cut if it proves to be too time consuming and not plausible within the project's scope.

### Invitation Links

If a user clicks an invitation link, after logging in/signing up, they will be prompted to accept or decline the partner request. If they accept, but already are on the partner matchmaking list, they will be removed, and if they themselves have sent out an invite, it will be deactivated. 

### Requesting a new Partner

If things aren't working out with a user's partner (for instance, they aren't compatible with their partner, or their partner rarely logs on), they can remove their current partner and request a new one. Again, they will be presented with the original two options for finding a partner. This removal will block the other user, so that the two will not be matched again.


## Scope

I believe this project to be of reasonable scope for a semester long project. It encompasses all of what we will be learning through the course (UX, front-end, back-end, a simple database for storing users and their goals), but it doesn't require an exceptional amount of depth or detail for any of these aspects. The matchmaking system may be a bit much, but we will consider it deeply and evaluate whether it is plausible as we go along.
